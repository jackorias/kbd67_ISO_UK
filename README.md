# KBD67 ISO UK Layout
Hex file and JSON file to be used with the QMK Online Configurator. (https://config.qmk.fm/#/)

File includes JSON so you can change anything you don't like, or add layers. This layout has Layer 1 set as F1-12 and is accessed using the FN Key. LED lighting is left as is, so do whatever you want with that. 

You can find all the other bits you need on the QMK website (https://qmk.fm/) or their Github (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) You will need to use the QMK Toolbox to flash your keyboard. 

I couldn't find anything like this when I first got the keyboard, and as I'd never used QMK before I struggled. This layout works for me and hopefully will help anyone else who's never used QMK before either.
